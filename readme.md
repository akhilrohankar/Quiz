### What does the program do ?
------------------------------

**This program at the start should read the data from qa.json. Then it will wait for user to select 1, 2, 3 options.** 


* 1 is to start the test, one question at a time is asked with options and user can select the answer. Correctness of the answer is checked and result shown. 

* Option 2 is to provide the over all score for all the questions being asnwered. 

* When option 3 is selected, user is asked a question then its options and correct answer. 
This is then added back to the qa.json and that is saved. 

* Option 4 to exit the program.

**When I re-run the program I will see the newly added question too.**
